# KBB_Cars
A data science driven approach to determine which cars depreciate the least based on the information available on the website [Kelley Blue Book](www.kbb.com).

# What is the problem?
Several factors influence a decision of buying a used car. While conventional wisdom definately has its place, I wanted to search for evidence-based results in making my decision. One of the important criteria for me in buying a car was to look for its depreciation value over time. Specifically, I wanted to buy a car that depreciates the least for short-term use of less than 3 years. 

Here, I web scrape Kelley Blue Book, a reputable website for searching for used cars in the US, to investigate how car values depreciate in general and identify which car make and model depreciates the least. In addition, I also examined effect of a location (city) on cost of specific car makes.
